# Progress: Speech-to-Speech Application with NVIDIA ACE

## What Works

- [x] Initial project planning and architecture design
- [x] Documentation setup (Memory Bank files)

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Basic Setup and Configuration

- [x] Configure the environment variables
- [x] Create the project directory structure

### Phase 2: Custom Components Development

- [x] Develop the custom Whisper ASR component
  - [x] Audio capture functionality
  - [x] Whisper API integration
  - [x] Redis event publishing
  - [x] Two-pass End of Utterance (EOU) detection
  - [x] Spurious transcript filtering

- [x] Develop the custom ElevenLabs TTS component
  - [x] Redis event subscription
  - [x] ElevenLabs API integration
  - [x] Audio playback functionality
  - [x] Barge-in support
  - [x] HTTP server for ACE integration

- [x] Create Docker containers for custom components
  - [x] Whisper ASR Dockerfile
  - [x] ElevenLabs TTS Dockerfile

### Phase 3: ACE Integration

- [x] Create custom bot configuration
  - [x] Bot configuration file
  - [x] Model configuration file
  - [x] Speech configuration file
  - [x] Colang files for conversation flow
  - [x] Custom actions for transcript filtering

- [x] Configure ACE for event interface
  - [x] Set up Redis for event streaming
  - [x] Configure the `speech_umim` pipeline

### Phase 4: System Integration

- [x] Create Docker Compose configuration
  - [x] Define all services
  - [x] Configure networking
  - [x] Set up volume mounts

- [x] Set up environment variables
  - [x] API keys
  - [x] Configuration paths

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Test the speech-to-text functionality
- [ ] Test the text-to-speech functionality
- [ ] Test the end-to-end conversation flow
- [ ] Test the barge-in functionality
- [ ] Validate the integration between components

## Progress Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 5 - Testing and Validation

**Overall Progress**: 90%

**Next Milestone**: Complete testing and validation

## Recent Updates

- Created Memory Bank files to document the project (March 27, 2025)
- Designed the hybrid architecture for the speech-to-speech application (March 27, 2025)
- Created custom components for Whisper ASR and ElevenLabs TTS (March 27, 2025)
- Implemented low latency features with two-pass EOU detection (March 27, 2025)
- Implemented barge-in support for natural conversation (March 27, 2025)
- Created custom bot configuration files with Colang flows (March 27, 2025)
- Created Docker Compose configuration for all components (March 27, 2025)

## Blockers and Issues

- None at this time

## Notes

- The project is designed to be extensible for future integration with animation components
- API keys for OpenAI Whisper and ElevenLabs will be required for development and testing
- The system uses a two-pass approach for End of Utterance detection:
  - First pass (240ms): Triggers an interim transcript for early processing
  - Second pass (800ms): Confirms the final transcript
