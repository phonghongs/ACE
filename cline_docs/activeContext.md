# Active Context: Enhanced Speech-to-Speech Application with NVIDIA ACE

## What We're Working On Now

We have completed the implementation of an enhanced speech-to-speech application using NVIDIA ACE with custom speech components. The application uses OpenAI Whisper API for speech-to-text and ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech instead of the default Riva components. We've also implemented advanced features like low latency responses and barge-in support.

## Recent Changes

1. Created Memory Bank files to document the project
2. Analyzed the ACE architecture and components
3. Designed a hybrid architecture that leverages ACE's event-based interface while integrating custom speech components
4. Created custom components for Whisper ASR and ElevenLabs TTS
5. Implemented low latency features with two-pass End of Utterance (EOU) detection:
   - First pass (240ms): Triggers an interim transcript for early processing
   - Second pass (800ms): Confirms the final transcript
6. Implemented barge-in support for natural conversation:
   - Users can interrupt the bot while it's speaking
   - The system stops TTS playback and processes the new input
7. Added spurious transcript filtering to improve conversation quality
8. Created custom bot configuration files with Colang flows
9. Created Docker Compose configuration for all components

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the speech-to-text functionality with various accents and background noise
   - Test the text-to-speech functionality with different types of responses
   - Test the end-to-end conversation flow with multiple turns
   - Test the barge-in functionality during bot responses
   - Validate the integration between all components

2. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application in a production environment
   - Monitor performance and make adjustments as needed
   - Optimize resource usage for better performance

3. **Future Extensions**:
   - Integrate with Audio2Face for facial animations
   - Integrate with Animation Graph for body movements
   - Enhance the conversational capabilities of the bot
   - Add support for multiple languages

The current focus is on testing and validating the enhanced speech-to-speech functionality to ensure that all components work together properly and the advanced features like low latency and barge-in support function as expected.
