# Docker Environment[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/docker-environment.html#docker-environment "Link to this heading")
**Prerequisites**
Before you start using NVIDIA ACE Agent, itâ€™s assumed that you meet the following prerequisites. The current version of ACE Agent is only supported on NVIDIA data center GPUs.
  1. You have access and are logged into NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC). You have installed the [NGC CLI tool](https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli) on the local system and you have [logged into the NGC container registry](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/gpu-cloud/ngc-catalog-user-guide/index.html#logging-in-to-ngc-registry). For more details about NGC, refer to the [NGC documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/#primary-documentation).
  2. You have [installed Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and the [NVIDIA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html). Ensure that you have gone through the [Docker post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) for managing Docker as a non-root user.
  3. You have access to an NVIDIA Volta, NVIDIA Turing, NVIDIA Ampere, NVIDIA Ada Lovelace, or an NVIDIA Hopper Architecture-based GPU.
  4. You have `python >= 3.8.10` and `pip >= 23.1.2` installed on your workstation.


**Setup**
  1. Download NVIDIA ACE Agent Quick Start Scripts by cloning the [GitHub ACE repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE).
> ```
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/ACE.git
cd ACE

```

  2. Go to the ACE Agent `microservices` directory.
> ```
cdmicroservices/ace_agent/4.1

```

  3. Set your NGC Personal API key in the `NGC_CLI_API_KEY` environment variable. Based on the botâ€™s configurations, you might need to export additional environment variables. For example, bots using OpenAI models will need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
> ```
exportNGC_CLI_API_KEY=...

```



**Deployment**
The [ACE Agent Quick Start package](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/ace_agent/4.1) comes with a `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml` for deploying microservices. Before running the Docker compose command, perform the following steps:
  1. Set the `BOT_PATH` environment variable to the directory containing the bot configurations.
> ```
exportBOT_PATH=<LOCALDirectoryPathContainingBot>

```

  2. Set the `PIPELINE` in `deploy/docker/docker_init.sh` depending on the deployment architecture. Use `speech_umim`, `avatar_umim`, or `live_portrait_umim` for the event interface and `speech_lite`, `avatar`, or `live_portrait` for the server interface. By default, it is set to `speech_umim` mode.
  3. Export the environment variables needed by sourcing `deploy/docker/docker_init.sh`.
> ```
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh

```

  4. Pass the environment variables to the ACE Agent containers. You can utilize the `.env` file present in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`.
  5. Stop all running Docker containers.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymldown

```



## CLI Interface[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/docker-environment.html#cli-interface "Link to this heading")
`chat-bot-cli` - gives you access to the Chat Engine Docker terminal and you can interact with the bot using your workstation terminal.
Chit Chat sample bot uses OpenAI `gpt-4-turbo` as the main model. The Chit Chat bot is present in the [quickstart directory](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/ace_agent/4.1) at `./samples/chitchat_bot`.
For deploying the Chit Chat sample bot, via the CLI interface, perform the following steps:
  1. Set the OpenAI API key environment variable.
> ```
exportOPENAI_API_KEY=...

```

  2. Prepare the environment for Docker compose commands.
> ```
exportBOT_PATH=./samples/chitchat_bot/
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh

```

  3. Deploy the ACE Agent containers. Deploy the Chat Engine, Plugin server, and NLP server containers. For starting the CLI Interface, we will issue `docker exec` in the Chat Engine container.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupchat-bot-cli-d
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlexecchat-bot-cli$CLI_CMD

```

  4. Interact with the bot by providing user queries via the CLI.
> ```
[YOU] Are you a person
[BOT] I'm not a real person, but I certainly exist.
[YOU] What is your name?
[BOT] I don't have a name. Or I don't know it.

```

  5. Stop all running Docker containers.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymldown

```



## HTTP Server Interface[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/docker-environment.html#http-server-interface "Link to this heading")
`chat-bot` - an HTTP web server is deployed with only textual chat support.
The Stock bot uses the `gpt-4-turbo` model from OpenAI as the main model. The Stock bot is present in the [quickstart directory](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/ace_agent/4.1) at `./samples/stock_bot`.
For deploying the Stock sample bot, via the Server interface, perform the following steps:
  1. Set the OpenAI API key environment variable.
> ```
exportOPENAI_API_KEY=...

```

  2. Prepare the environment for the Docker compose commands.
> ```
exportBOT_PATH=./samples/stock_bot/
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh

```

  3. Deploy the ACE Agent microservices. Deploy the Chat Engine, Plugin server, and NLP Server containers.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupchat-bot-d

```

> You can interact with the bot using the URL `http://<workstation IP>:7006/`.

[![Stock Market bot sample](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/_images/stock-market-bot-qsg.png) ](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/_images/stock-market-bot-qsg.png)
  1. Stop deployment.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymldown

```



## Event Interface[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/docker-environment.html#event-interface "Link to this heading")
The ACE Agent event interface provides an asynchronous, event-based interface to interact with bots written in Colang 2.0 that allows bots to make full use of all features in UMIM (Unified Multimodal Interaction Management).
The Stock sample bot is present in the [quickstart directory](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/ace_agent/4.1) at `./samples/stock_bot`. Stock sample bot uses OpenAI gpt-4-turbo as the main model.
For starting the Colang 2.0 sample bot via the Event Interface, perform the following steps:
  1. Set OpenAI API key environment variable.
> ```
exportOPENAI_API_KEY=...

```

  2. Prepare the environment for the Docker compose commands.
> ```
exportBOT_PATH=./samples/stock_bot
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh

```

  3. Deploy the ACE Agent microservices. Deploy the Chat Engine, Plugin server, and NLP server containers along with the Redis container.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupevent-bot-d

```

> You can interact with the bot using the URL `http://<workstation IP>:7006/`.

[![Stock Market bot sample](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/_images/stock-market-bot-qsg.png) ](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/_images/stock-market-bot-qsg.png)
  1. Stop deployment.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymldown

```



## gRPC Interface with HTTP Interface[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/docker-environment.html#grpc-interface-with-http-interface "Link to this heading")
A gRPC web server is deployed with voice capture and playback support.
The Stock bot uses the `gpt-4-turbo` model from OpenAI as the main model. The Stock bot is present in the [quickstart directory](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/ace_agent/4.1) at `./samples/stock_bot`.
> Note
> The HTTP Interface can only be used for bots that have `colang_disable_async_execution: True` config in the `bot_config.yaml` file because the HTTP interface needs to respond in synchronous mode for each user query.
For deploying the Stock sample bot, via the gRPC Interface, perform the following steps:
  1. Set the OpenAI API key environment variable.
> ```
exportOPENAI_API_KEY=...

```

  2. Prepare the environment for the Docker compose commands.
> ```
exportBOT_PATH=./samples/stock_bot/
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh

```

  3. For Server interface based bots, we need to use `speech_lite`, `avatar`, or `live_portrait` pipeline configuration for the Chat Controller microservice. Update the `PIPELINE` variable in `deploy/docker/docker_init.sh` or override by setting the `PIPELINE` environment variable manually.
> ```
exportPIPELINE=speech_lite

```

  4. Deploy the Speech and NLP models required for the bot which might take 20-40 minutes for the first time. For the Stock sample bot, Riva ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text to Speech) models will be deployed.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupmodel-utils-speech

```

  5. Deploy the ACE Agent microservices. Deploy the Chat Controller, Chat Engine, Plugin server, NLP server, and WebUI microservices.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupspeech-bot-d

```

  6. Wait for a few minutes for all services to be ready, you can check the Docker logs for individual microservices to confirm. You will see log print `Server listening on 0.0.0.0:50055` in the Docker logs for the Chat Controller container.
  7. Interact with the bot using the URL `http://<workstation IP>:7006/`. For accessing the mic on the browser, you need to enable the `insecure origins treated as secure flag` in your `chrome://flags/` or `edge://flags/` and allow `http://<workstation IP>:7006` as a secure endpoint.


Alternatively, you can use [the Python sample gPRC client](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/sample-clients.html#grpc-server-sample-client) present in the [Quick Start resource](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/ace_agent/4.1).
## Event Interface with Speech[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/docker-environment.html#event-interface-with-speech "Link to this heading")
For speech-to-speech conversation, you can deploy a gRPC server along with an event interface.
The Stock sample bot is present in the [quickstart directory](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/ace_agent/4.1) at `./samples/stock_bot`. The Stock sample bot uses OpenAI `gpt-4-turbo` as the main model.
For deploying the Stock sample bot, via the gRPC Interface, perform the following steps:
  1. Set the OpenAI API key environment variable.
> ```
exportOPENAI_API_KEY=...

```

  2. Prepare the environment for the Docker compose commands.
> ```
exportBOT_PATH=./samples/stock_bot
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh

```

  3. For event based bots, we need to use `speech_umim`, `live_portrait_umim`, or `avatar_umim` pipeline configuration for the Chat Controller microservice. Make sure the `PIPELINE` variable in `deploy/docker/docker_init.sh` is set properly otherwise, we need to override by setting the `PIPELINE` environment variable manually.
> ```
exportPIPELINE=speech_umim

```

  4. Deploy the Speech and NLP models required for the bot which might take 20-40 minutes for the first time. For the Colang 2.0 sample bot, Riva ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text to Speech) models will be deployed.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupmodel-utils-speech

```

  5. Deploy the ACE Agent microservices. Deploy the Chat Controller, Chat Engine, Plugin server, WebUI, and NLP server microservices along with the Redis container.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupspeech-event-bot-d

```

  6. Wait for a few minutes for all services to be ready, you can check the Docker logs for individual microservices to confirm. You will see log print `Server listening on 0.0.0.0:50055` in the Docker logs for the Chat Controller container.
  7. Interact with the bot using the URL `http://<workstation IP>:7006/`. For accessing the mic on the browser, you need to enable the `insecure origins treated as secure` flag in your `chrome://flags/` or `edge://flags/` and allow `http://<workstation IP>:7006` as a secure endpoint.

[![Stock Market bot sample](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/_images/stock-market-bot.png) ](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/_images/stock-market-bot.png)
Alternatively, you can use [the Python sample gPRC client](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/sample-clients.html#grpc-server-sample-client) present in the [Quick Start resource](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/ace_agent/4.1).
## Model Deployment[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/docker-environment.html#model-deployment "Link to this heading")
For deploying all models required for the bot, perform the following steps:
  1. Prepare the environment for the Docker compose commands.
> ```
exportBOT_PATH=<BOTDirectorycontainingmodel_config.yaml>
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh

```

  2. Deploy the NLP models.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupmodel-utils

```

  3. Deploy the Speech and NLP models required for the bot.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupmodel-utils-speech
