  * For Autonomous Vehicle (AV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research and Development AV and AI technologies require access to large volumes of high-quality data to learn how to perceive, classify, and navigate among people, objects, and scenes. We collect public images and other data through sensors on NVIDIA or partner-identified vehicles and in clearly disclosed public spaces–as well as datasets collected by others–to improve the safety and reliability of our AV and AI models. This data is never cross-referenced with personal data from any other product or service and if anonymized, NVIDIA will maintain and use information in anonymized form and will not attempt to re-identify it unless permitted by law. **See More****See Less**

NVIDIA does not use, sell, or share “sensitive personal information” as defined by California law. However, our sharing of non-sensitive data with advertising providers may qualify as the sale of personal data or the sharing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising. 
From time to time, we may launch certain products or features (e.g., demos or beta technologies) that involve collection of personal data that falls outside the scope of this privacy policy. In those instances, we will provide you with additional privacy-related information and disclosures at the time of collection. The additional privacy disclosures will supplement this Privacy Policy and govern how we may process the personal data collected at that time.
## Sharing Hashed Data for Interest-based Advertising on Third-party Platforms
If you’ve consented to receive marketing communications or recommendations, we share hashed details about your identity with third-party ad providers such as Google to serve interest-based ads to you and others. These hashed details may include your name, email, phone number, job title, organizational business affiliations, zip code, country, and social media handles.
Your information is shared in hashed form only, which means that your details are irreversibly converted to a fixed-size string of characters such as “0890f456684a70f1a9f1dbcee40c1fe847b76f338581a9a1d9202c76b1c175f4” (which is the SHA-256 hash of “NVIDIA”). Sharing information in hashed form means that third-party ad providers can only identify you if they already have the information we have shared and have hashed it themselves to match the hashed version we are sharing. Sharing information in hashed form is a way of identifying information that both parties have without sharing the information itself.
You can opt out of data sharing for interest-based advertising at any time by visiting our [Privacy Center](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/privacy-center/) or by enabling an opt-out preference signal.
## How to Set Up and Use an Opt-Out Preference Signal
NVIDIA websites detect and respond to Global Privacy Control signals by disabling all Performance, Personalization, and Advertising cookies. We also automatically adjust your preferences in our Privacy Center when we are able to connect the Global Privacy Control signal to your account or email. To enable this signal, download and use a browser or browser extension that supports the Global Privacy Control.
## Data on NVIDIA Websites
If you visit any of our NVIDIA websites, we or our third-party partners collect information using cookies, web beacons, or log file information. Please see our [Cookie Policy ](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/cookie-policy/)for more details.
## Children’s Privacy Policy 
We take special care to protect the privacy of children, and our products and services are not targeted for use by children under the age of 13. We only collect data from children who are above the age of digital consent in their jurisdiction (e.g., at least 13 for the United States), or if we have express parental consent (e.g., for attendance at one of our conferences).
We share some personal data of account holders under the age of 18 if sharing personal data is required for service functionality. For example, if an account holder under the age of 18 is using NVIDIA services via one of our GeForce NOW Alliance partners, we share the account holder’s operating system version, network type, games played, session time, ratings and feedback, error data, and a masked version of the account holder’s IP address with that GeForce NOW Alliance Partner to enable service functionality.
If an account holder under the age of 18 uses an ad-supported GeForce NOW plan, we share the account holder’s IP address, country, platform, and game title for purposes of fraud prevention and ad frequency capping. We also share this information as well as age range for purposes of interest-based advertising if the account holder is 16 or older. Account holders below the age of 16 are opted out of interest-based advertising by default, and all account holders may opt out of interest-based advertising by visiting our [Privacy Center](http://privacy.nvidia.com).
We employ reasonable technological safeguards to comply with local laws, and to prevent underage children from accessing areas of our services where personal information may be collected. For example, underage children are not allowed to participate in our user-to-user forums, subscribe to an email newsletter, or enter any of our sweepstakes or contests.
Please contact us if you become aware that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent.
## Cross-Border Data Transfer 
NVIDIA is located in California, and in most cases we need to securely transfer and store your information in the United States. Transfers of personal data to the United States, and to or from NVIDIA, are made subject to the [Standard Contractual Clauses ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en)which have been pre-approved by the European Commission and ensure appropriate data protection safeguards.

This means we adhere to the Data Privacy Framework Principles of notice, choice, and accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement, and liability. We are the data controller, and we remain responsible for any of your personal information that is shared with third parties for processing on our behalf.
NVIDIA has committed to cooperating with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with regard to unresolved Data Privacy Framework complaints concerning data transferred from the EU Switzerland, and the UK. Under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration to resolve any complaint. We are subject to U.S. law, and we may be required to share data with U.S. law enforcement agencies.
