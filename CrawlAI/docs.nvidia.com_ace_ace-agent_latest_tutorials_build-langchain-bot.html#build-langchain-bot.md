# Building LangChain-Based Bots[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/tutorials/build-langchain-bot.html#building-langchain-based-bots "Link to this heading")
In this section, letâ€™s build a bot that uses a [LangChain runnable](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/interface/) to drive the conversation. We will build a LangChain agent that performs DuckDuckGo searches and answers questions in the context of the conversation. You can swap out this agent with their own chains/agents in this tutorial. You can learn about [LangChain Runnable Interface](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#runnable-interface), [LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/langserve/), [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), and a few other terminologies mentioned by following [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/). You can cross reference the [DuckDuckGo LangChain Sample bot](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/sample-bots/duckduckgo-langchain-bot.html#duckduckgo-langchain-bot) for code or any issues in the tutorial steps.
The interaction with the LangChain runnable will happen via a custom Plugin server. In this tutorial, we will define a LangChain runnable directly in the custom Plugin server. However, you can also choose to deploy your LangChain runnables via LangServe and have your custom Plugins interact with the LangServe APIs using remote runnables.
The minimal file structure of the LangChain bot looks like this:
> ```
samples
â””â”€â”€ langchain_tutorial_bot
  â””â”€â”€ plugin
    â””â”€â”€ langchain_agent.py
    â””â”€â”€ schemas.py
  â””â”€â”€ plugin_config.yaml
  â””â”€â”€ speech_config.yaml
  â””â”€â”€ model_config.yaml

```

Create an empty directory called `samples/langchain_tutorial_bot` and perform the following steps for updating bot configurations.
For the LangChain or custom RAG pipelines that do not require processing or guardrailing with Colang, you can directly connect the Chat Controller to the Plugin server. Follow the [plugin server architecture](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/architecture/arch-intro.html#plugin-serv-arch) section for more information. We will demonstrate this approach below.
## Creating the LangChain Plugin[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/tutorials/build-langchain-bot.html#creating-the-langchain-plugin "Link to this heading")
In this section, letâ€™s build the custom LangChain Plugin and test it as a standalone component.
  1. Define the input and output API schemas used by ACE Agent for communication with the Plugin server and Chat Controller. Update `plugin/schemas.py` with the following contents.
> ```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, Dict, List, Any

class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
  Query: Optional[str] = Field(default="", description="The user query which needs to be processed.")
  UserId: str = Field(
    description="Mandatory unique identifier to recognize which user is interacting with the Chat Engine."
  )
Metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(
  default={},
  description="Any additional information related to the request.",
)

class EventRequest(BaseModel):
  EventType: str = Field(default="", description="The event name which needs to be processed.")
  UserId: str = Field(
    description="Mandatory unique identifier to recognize which user is interacting with the Chat Engine."
  )

class ResponseField(BaseModel):
  Text: str = Field(
    default="",
    description="Text response to be sent out. This field will also be picked by a Text to Speech Synthesis module if enabled for speech based bots.",
  )
  CleanedText: str = Field(
    default="", description="Text response from the Chat Engine with all SSML/HTML tags removed."
  )
  NeedUserResponse: Optional[bool] = Field(
    default=True,
    description="This field can be used by end user applications to deduce if user response is needed or not for a dialog initiated query. This is set to true automatically if form filling is active and one or more slots are missing.",
  )
  IsFinal: bool = Field(
    default=False,
    description="This field to indicate the final response chunk when streaming. The chunk with IsFinal=true will contain the full Chat Engine response attributes.",
  )

class ChatResponse(BaseModel):
  UserId: str = Field(
    default="",
    description="Unique identifier to recognize which user is interacting with the Chat Engine. This is populated from the request JSON.",
  )
  QueryId: str = Field(
    default="",
    description="Unique identifier for the user query assigned automatically by the Chat Engine unless specified in request JSON.",
  )
  Response: ResponseField = Field(
    default=ResponseField(),
    description="Final response template from the Chat Engine. This field can be picked up from domain rule files or can be formulated directly from custom plugin modules.",
  )
  Metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(
    default={"SessionId": "", "StreamId": ""},
    description="Any additional information related to the request.",
  )

class EventResponse(BaseModel):
  UserId: str = Field(
    default="",
    description="Unique identifier to recognize which user is interacting with the Chat Engine. This is populated from the request JSON.",
  )
  Events: List[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(
    default=[], description="The generated event list for the provided EventType from Chat Engine."
  )
  Response: ResponseField = Field(
    default=ResponseField(),
    description="Final response template from the Chat Engine. This field can be picked up from domain rule files or can be formulated directly from custom plugin modules.",
  )

```

> Letâ€™s understand the APIs and their schemas a little. There are two APIs used by the Chat Controller microservice: `/chat` and `/event`.
>     1. Events such as pipeline creation and deletion are sent by the Chat Controller to the `/event` endpoint. In most cases, you will not need to modify the default `/event` endpoint that we will define in the next step.
>     2. User questions are sent by the Chat Controller to the `/chat` endpoint, along with the `UserId` and an optional `QueryId`. The response schema for this API contains a `Response` attribute, which contains the details of the response. In this tutorial, we only need to manage two sub-fields: `Response.Text` (which contains the chunk that we are streaming) and `Response.IsFinal` (which indicates whether the stream is complete).
  2. Create the actual custom Plugin with the LangChain agent and the `/chat` and `/event` APIs. Update `plugin/langchain_agent.py` with the following code:

```

> Letâ€™s understand the above code.
>     1. The `ddg_search` tool takes in the query, performs a DuckDuckGo search, and returns the top responses.
>     2. The `rephraser_prompt` is used to rephrase the current question into a single, simple question based on the conversation history, represented by the `history` placeholder.
>     3. The `chain` runnable performs rephrasing of the query, passes the rephrased to the `ddg_search` tool, and finally calls the LLM again to fetch the answer from the DuckDuckGo search results.
>     4. The `chain_with_history` is the actual runnable that we will be using to generate answers. It fetches the correct conversation history based on the `session_id` and populates the `rephraser_prompt` with the right inputs.
>     5. Finally, the `/chat` endpoint invokes the `chain_with_history` with the right inputs. In this case, we return a generator where we call the `stream` method of the runnable, format the response into the `ChatResponse` schema, and push the chunk into the response stream.
> If you are using a custom LangChain runnable or if you want to modify the way you call the runnable, you will only need to make changes in the `generator` method.
  3. Register this plugin. Add the following to `plugin_config.yaml`.
> ```
config:
workers:1
timeout:30
plugins:
-name:langchain
path:./plugin/langchain_agent.py

```

  4. Add the Python dependencies used by this runnable in `deploy/docker/dockerfiles/plugin_server.Dockerfile`. This will install the custom dependencies when the Plugin server is being built.
> ```
##############################
# Install custom dependencies
##############################
RUNpipinstalllangchain==0.1.1\
langchain-community==0.0.13\
langchain-core==0.1.12\
duckduckgo-search==5.3.1b1

```



Note
If you see a crash in the plugin server or an issue with fetching a response from DuckDuckGo, try using a more recent `duckduckgo-search` version.
  1. Deploy the Plugin server for testing.
>     1. Set the OpenAI API key if it is not already set.
>> ```
exportOPENAI_API_KEY=...

```

>     2. Run the bot using the [Docker Environment](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/deployment/docker-environment.html#docker-environment).
>> ```
exportBOT_PATH=./samples/langchain_tutorial_bot
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlup--buildplugin-server-d

```

  2. We can test the endpoint by running the following CURL command:
> ```
curl -X 'POST' \
 'http://localhost:9002/langchain/chat' \
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -d '{
 "Query": "Who is the president of the United States?",
 "UserId": "user1"
}'

```

  3. After you are done testing the plugin, to stop the server, run:
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymldown

```



## Connecting the Plugin to the Chat Controller[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/tutorials/build-langchain-bot.html#connecting-the-plugin-to-the-chat-controller "Link to this heading")
Now that the Plugin is functional, letâ€™s create the configs to connect the Chat Controller to the Plugin server, as well as enable speech.
> [![LangChain UCS App](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/_images/langchain-ucs-app.png) ](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-agent/latest/_images/langchain-ucs-app.png)
  1. Copy the `model_config.yaml` and `speech_config.yaml` files from `samples/chitchat_bot`. They represent the common settings for a speech pipeline.
  2. Update the `server` URL in the `dialog_manager` component in the `speech_config.yaml` file to point to the plugin we created in the previous section.
> ```
dialog_manager:
DialogManager:
server:"http://localhost:9002/langchain"
use_streaming:true

```

> With this change, the Chat Controller will directly call the `/chat` and `/event` endpoints of the Plugin server.
  3. Deploy the bot using the Docker environment.
  4. Set the environment variables required for the `docker-compose.yml` file.
> ```
exportBOT_PATH=./samples/langchain_tutorial_bot/
sourcedeploy/docker/docker_init.sh

```

  5. For Plugin Server Architecture bots, we need to use the `speech_lite` pipeline configuration for the Chat Controller microservice. Update the `PIPELINE` variable in `deploy/docker/docker_init.sh` or override by setting the `PIPELINE` environment variable manually.
> ```
exportPIPELINE=speech_lite

```

  6. Deploy the Riva ASR and TTS speech models.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupmodel-utils-speech

```

  7. Deploy the Plugin server with the LangChain plugin.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlup--buildplugin-server-d

```

  8. Deploy the Chat Controller microservice with the gRPC interface.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupchat-controller-d

```

  9. Deploy the speech sample frontend application.
> ```
dockercompose-fdeploy/docker/docker-compose.ymlupbot-web-ui-clientbot-web-ui-speech-d

```

> Notice that we are not deploying the Chat Engine microservice at all.
> You can interact with the bot using your browser at `http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:7006`.


Hereâ€™s an example dialog with the bot.
