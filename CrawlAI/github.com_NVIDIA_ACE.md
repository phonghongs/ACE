## The Key Benefits of ACE
[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE#the-key-benefits-of-ace)
### State-of-the-Art Models and Microservices
[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE#state-of-the-art-models-and-microservices)
NVIDIA pre-trained models provide industry-leading quality and real-time performance.
### Safe and Consistent Results
[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE#safe-and-consistent-results)
AI models trained on commercially safe, responsibly licensed data. Fine-tuning and guardrails enable accurate, appropriate, and on-topic results no matter the user's input.
### Flexible Deployment Options
[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE#flexible-deployment-options)
Handle inference through any public or private cloud, Windows PC, or a mix of both.
## Digital Human Workflows
[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE#digital-human-workflows)
Developers can leverage ACE to build their own digital human solutions from the ground up, or use NVIDIA's suite of domain-specific AI workflows for next-generation non-playable game characters (NPCs), interactive digital assistants for customer service, and digital avatars for real-time communication.
### Gaming Characters
[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE#gaming-characters)
NVIDIA Kairos Sample showcases an easy to use Unreal Engine project using the Audio2Face microservice. This sample shows how to connect Audio2Face to Metahuman and configure the Audio2Face microserivce.
[Learn More About ACE NIMs for Gaming](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/gaming)
### Customer Service
[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE#customer-service)
NVIDIA Tokkio is a digital assistant workflow built with ACE, bringing AI-powered customer service capabilities to healthcare, financial services, and retail. It comes to life using state-of-the-art real-time language, speech, and animation generative AI models alongside retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to convey specific and up-to-date information to customers.
